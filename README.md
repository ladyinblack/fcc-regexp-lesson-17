### [Match Ending String Patterns](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/regular-expressions/match-ending-string-patterns)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
To finish this challenge, it's necessary to use **boundaries**.

The `$` matches end of input.

For example, `/t$/` does not match the `t` in `eater`, but does match it in `eat`.

**Important**: If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately before a line break character.
