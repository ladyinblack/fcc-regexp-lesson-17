## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
To finish this challenge, it's necessary to use **boundaries**.

The `$` matches end of input.

For example, `/t$/` does not match the `t` in `eater`, but does match it in `eat`.

**Important**: If the multiline flag is set to true, also matches immediately before a line break character.
